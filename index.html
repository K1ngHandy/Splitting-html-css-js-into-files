  <p>The problems involve extracting the CSS and the JavaScript out of the HTML and into dedicated files.</p>
  <p>If they are solved correctly, the logo should render exactly the same way.</p>
  <div id="logo"></div>
  <!-- 
  ❗ PROBLEM 2
  👉 Extract the JavaScript code below (do not worry about how it works) to the `index.js` file.
  👉 After this is done, remove this
  <script> tag and link your `index.js` to the HTML using a < script > tag with a`src` atribute pointing to the file.
    👉 Placement of the < script > tag is important.If the code affects the HTML, then the script must be placed ** after ** the elements the script cares about.
    👉 An alternative to this is placing the < script > inside the < head >, but adding to the < script > a`defer` attribute.
